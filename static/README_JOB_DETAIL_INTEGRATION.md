## Integration Details

### Flask Route

Added a new route to handle job detail pages:

```python
@app.route('/job_detail/<job_id>')
def job_detail(job_id):
    # Check if user is logged in
    if 'user_email' not in session:
        flash('Please log in to view job details!', 'danger')
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
        
    user = User.query.filter_by(email=session['user_email']).first()
    
    # In a real application, you would fetch the job details from a database
    # using the job_id parameter. For now, we'll just pass the job_id to the template.
    return render_template('job_detail.html', user=user, job_id=job_id)
```
